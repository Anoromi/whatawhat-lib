# Whatawhat-lib

A collection of utils for windows and linux for collecting activity data. Works for x11, windows, gnome ([with extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5592/focused-window-d-bus/)), kde and other [wayland compositors](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-foreign-toplevel-management-unstable-v1).

Mostly just an adaptation of [awatcher](https://github.com/2e3s/awatcher), that's easier to interface with.

Separated into library to avoid having to make `whatawhat` into an MPL licensed project.
